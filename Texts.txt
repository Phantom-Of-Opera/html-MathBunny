In math's complex realm, a plastic cap asserts dominance,
Navigating equations with precision, solidifying brilliance.


Yo, I’m the bunny with the brain, gotta calculate my fame,
Add it up, carry one, mathematics is my game.
Angles, roots, and ratios, I’m solving them quick,
A math-loving legend with a rhythmic kick!



Yo, I’m the bunny with the brain, gotta calculate my fame,
Add it up, carry one, mathematics is my game.
Got my carrot in my paw, pencil in the other,
Solving equations slicker than your average brother.

I see the world in numbers, yeah, I break it all down,
Geometric genius, wearing angles like a crown.
From the squares to the roots, I’m the factor king,
Multiplying my rhymes, hear this bunny sing!

So if you’re feeling stuck, and math’s got you blue,
Just call this bunny, I’ll help you get through.
From calculus to primes, I’m the rap prodigy,
Math’s my jam, and this bunny’s the G!




How does a math-loving bunny with a carrot in his paw,
Master every theorem, leaving doubters in awe?
From the primes to the powers, yo, I’m breaking the law,
Of limits—pushing boundaries without a single flaw.

Calculating faster than a calculator spins,
I’m plotting out my future like a graph that wins.
Integration, permutation, my formulas slay,
This bunny’s revolutionizing math every day!
